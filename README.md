After 1 year pause Testing and Automation devroom is coming again to
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/). This room is about building better
software through a focus on testing and automation at all layers of
the stack. From creating libraries and end-user applications all the
way down to packaging, distribution and deployment. Testing and
automation is not isolated to a single toolchain, language or
platform, there is much to learn and share regardless of background!

# What

Since Testing and Automation devroom has been a regular at FOSDEM, here are some
ideas of what we would like to see, and what worked in prior years, they're just
ideas though. Check out the
[2017](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/),
[2018](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/)
schedules for inspiration.

### Testing in the real, open source world

* War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects
* Demistyfy resource e.g. systems/device/cloud provisioning in a CI loop
* Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code, for example bootloaders, init systems, etc.
* Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"
* Address the automated testing frameworks fragmentation
* Lessons learned from testing


### Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)

* How your open source tool made developing quality software better
* What tools do you use to setup your CI/CD
* Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things "Not enough
people in the open source community know how to use $X, but here's a
tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."
