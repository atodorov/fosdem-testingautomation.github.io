# Why
This is the fourth year for the Testing/Automation dev room at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2016). This room is about creating better software through a focus on testing and automation at all layers of the stack. From creating libraries and end-user applications all the way down to packaging, distribution and deployment. Testing and automation is not isolated to a single toolchain, language or platform, there is much to learn and share regardless of background!

# What
Since this is the fourth year we're hosting the Testing and Automation dev room, here are some ideas of what we would like to see, and what worked in prior years, they're just ideas though! Check out the [2013](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/), [2014](https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/), and [2015](https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/) schedules for inspiration.

### Testing in the real, open source world
* War stories/strategies for testing large scale or complex projects
* Tools that extend the ability to test low-level code
* Projects that are introducing new/interesting ways of testing "systems"

### Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)
* Explain/demo how your open source tool made developing quality software better
* Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X, but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."

# Where
FOSDEM is hosted at [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2016/practical/transportation/). The Testing and Automation dev room is currently slated for Building U, room 2.220, which seats ~290.
