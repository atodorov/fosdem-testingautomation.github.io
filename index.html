        <p>We will be hosting a developer room all day Sunday, February 1st 2015 at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/">FOSDEM</a>.</p>

<p>Please submit one (or more) 30-40 minute talk proposal(s) OR one (or more) 10 minute lightning talk proposal(s) by <strong>23:59 UTC on December 1st 2014</strong>. We will notify all those submitting proposals about their acceptance by December 15th 2014.
This is the third year for the Testing/Automation dev room at FOSDEM. This room is about creating better software through a focus on testing and automation at all layers of the stack. From creating libraries and end-user applications all the way down to packaging, distribution and deployment. Testing and automation is not isolated to a single toolchain, language or platform, there is much to learn and share regardless of background!</p>

<p>Since this is the third year we're hosting the Testing and Automation dev room, here are some ideas of what we would like to see, and what worked in prior years, they're just ideas though!</p>

<p>Testing in the real, open source world</p>

<ul>
<li>How has your open source project has gone from not-so-good to absolutely-great by applying testing best practices (TDD, BDD, ATDD, etc)</li>
<li>How to test and develop for open source projects (e.g. test-driving operating systems, big projects, ensuring quality of Linux distros, etc)</li>
<li>Talk about how your project is automated to make contributors' lives better (and/or on-boarding new contributors)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cool Tools (good candidates for lightning talks)</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain/demo how your open source tool made developing quality software better</li>
<li>Combining projects/plugins/tools to build amazing things "Not enough people in the open source community know how to use $X, but here's a tutorial on how to use $X to make your project better."</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit a talk proposal (you can submit multiple proposals if you'd like) with <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15">Pentabarf</a>, the FOSDEM paper submission system. You can create an account, or use an existing account if you already have one.</p>

<p>Please note: FOSDEM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FLOSS</a> community event, by and for the community, please ensure your topic is appropriate (i.e. this isn't the right forum for commercial product presentations)</p>
